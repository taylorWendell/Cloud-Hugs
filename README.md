# Cloud-Hugs
Coding for a website and/or a device that is used to reach out to others. This can be as simple as "I miss you" or as strong as "I need assistance immediately."

The Cloud-Hugs app is not used to diagnose or treat any major mental illness. It is a tool to create a support network of individuals coping with these illnesses. 

To use Cloud-Hugs, just tap one of the buttons. The other people in your support network will receive a push notification (current version) or their phone will vibrate (beta version).

Thank you for downloading Cloud-Hugs. Please contact customer support at supp.cs.ort@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions.
